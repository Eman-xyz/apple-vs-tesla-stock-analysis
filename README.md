# apple-vs-tesla-stock-analysis
This project analyzes and compares the stock performance of **Apple (AAPL)** and **Tesla (TSLA)** over a 5-year period using Python. It includes:

- Daily return calculation
- Cumulative return growth
- Rolling volatility (30-day standard deviation)
- Descriptive statistics

The project is built using tools and techniques from the Coursera course: **"Python and Statistics for Financial Analysis."**

## ðŸ“Š Project Goals

- Understand and visualize daily return behavior
- Compare long-term investment growth between two stocks
- Analyze risk using volatility metrics
- Apply statistics to real financial data

---

## ðŸ§  Key Techniques Used

- `yfinance` to pull historical market data  
- `pandas` for data cleaning and transformation  
- `matplotlib` for plotting and visualization  
- Rolling windows, percent change, and cumulative product functions  
- Summary statistics with `.describe()`

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries

- Python 3  
- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- yfinance  
- Jupyter Notebook
